## Where can I find MAME with Iskra Delta Partner emulator?

## How can I compile MAME with Iskra Delta emulator

make SUBTARGET=id SOURCES=src/mame/sfrj/idpartner.cpp -j4 REGENIE=1 TOOLS=1

Start it and fetch a coffee, it'll take some time. After the compilation the
root directory contains program ./id. Since there already is a program id on
Linux, we renamed this to idp-mame to prevent conflicts.

## Where can I download ROMS?

Download all roms (using torrent) from here (latest version, merged)

Unpack ROM zip files (don't unzip individual rom zips, but do unzip the whole rom package) 
into your mame folder, subfolder roms/
