The Z80 CTC (Counter/Timer Circuit) is a peripheral device that provides up to four independent programmable counters or timers. The Z80 CTC has a total of 8 I/O ports which are organized into 4 registers, each register being 2 bytes wide. The starting I/O port address for the Z80 CTC is usually specified as 0xC8.

Here is a summary of the eight I/O ports for the Z80 CTC:

    Port 0xC8: Control Register 0 (CR0). This register controls the operating mode and prescaler of Counter/Timer 0.

    Port 0xC9: Counter/Timer 0 (CT0). This is the actual 16-bit counter or timer for Counter/Timer 0.

    Port 0xCA: Control Register 1 (CR1). This register controls the operating mode and prescaler of Counter/Timer 1.

    Port 0xCB: Counter/Timer 1 (CT1). This is the actual 16-bit counter or timer for Counter/Timer 1.

    Port 0xCC: Control Register 2 (CR2). This register controls the operating mode and prescaler of Counter/Timer 2.

    Port 0xCD: Counter/Timer 2 (CT2). This is the actual 16-bit counter or timer for Counter/Timer 2.

    Port 0xCE: Control Register 3 (CR3). This register controls the operating mode and prescaler of Counter/Timer 3.

    Port 0xCF: Counter/Timer 3 (CT3). This is the actual 16-bit counter or timer for Counter/Timer 3.

Each of the control registers (CR0-CR3) has its own set of control bits that determine the operating mode, prescaler, and other parameters for the associated counter or timer. The actual counter or timer values are accessed through the CT0-CT3 ports.

You will need to consult the documentation for your specific Z80 CTC chip to understand the details of each of these registers and how to program and use the Z80 CTC to meet your requirements.
